I am a computational scientist whose been steeped in research.
I earned my PhD in computational atomic physics at the `University of Tennessee`_
and the `Joint Institute of Computational Sciences`_ at located at `Oak Ridge National Laboratories`_.
My first post-doctoral research project was at `University of California Irvine`_
where I used using machine learning to identify stem cell phase using DNA morphology.
Later at `Loma Linda University`_ I joined a translational research team
creating a proton radiation to improve medical imaging (creating a proton computed
tomography scanner) and pioneering radiosurgery using small animals models.
Afterwords, I joined a prosective dietary cohort (N=96,000) as a Data Analyst.
Having experiencing the vagaries of grant-funded research, I transitioned to education
where I enjoyed a new set of challenges.

Why a statistics blog
---------------------
I got taught myself a lot of math during my BA in math and PhD in physics.
However, I managed to avoid completing a formal statistics course.
It has been my experience that `Richard Feynman`_ [#]_ was correct when
he said that teaching is the best way to learn something.
So in this blog, I'll be writing about interesting applications of probability and statistics.
