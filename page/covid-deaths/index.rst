.. description: Comparison of 2019 and 2020 COVID deaths
.. type: text

I'm comparing deaths from natural causes (not homocide) between 2020 and 2019. After my interest
was piqued by a retracted article from John's Hopkins University, I
went to the CDC_ to acquire data. After some tinkering, I
figured decided to use facets to squeeze two categories (year, month)
on the x-axis while being able to stack (categorical) diseases on the y-axis.

These were generated by the following code.
