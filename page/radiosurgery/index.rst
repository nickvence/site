Motivation
----------

Cardiac arrhythmia is a deadly condition in which one's heart beat becomes irregular
and results in one being starved for oxygen. The current treatment for atrial
fibrilation (a type of cardiac arrhythmia) is by cauterizing (burning) part of the
heart to use scar tissue to electrically isolate the tissue generating the spurious
electrical impulse.

Knowing that proton radiation kill cells and creates scar tissue, our research team
was designing a non-invaisve treatment using a proton beam.  In the dose finding study,
we used a rat model to test how much proton radiation was necessary to scar cardiac
tissue.


The animal procedure involved applying
